# How to play

## Objective:
Your goal in the game is to collect all the blue boxes scattered around the level by making the tower collapse. To do this, you need to shoot the balls at the right places of the tower, making it unstable and eventually fall down.

## Shooting:
To shoot, press and hold the left mouse button to increase the force of the shot, then release to shoot the ball at the tower. Try to aim accurately to hit the right spots that will cause the tower to collapse with the least amount of shots possible.

## Panning:
To pan around the pedestal, press and hold the right mouse button while moving your mouse in the direction you want to look. This allows you to view the level from different angles and help you aim more accurately.

## Resetting the level:
If you get stuck or want to start the level over, press the "R" button to reset the level.

## Winning the game:
Once you have collected all the blue boxes, you have completed the level and won the game.

## Controls summary:
Left mouse button: shoot the ball to hit the blue boxes.
Right mouse button: pan around the pedestal.
R button: reset the level.
